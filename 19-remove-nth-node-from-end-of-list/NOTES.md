The Brute Force Solution is also fast enough for this problem, it gives 1ms running time but the interesting thing is to solve this problem in a single pass.The idea is that we want to solve this problem in one pass rather than passing twice to determine the size of the list. To achieve this idea we need to maintain two pointers fast and slow, let the fast pointer move n+1 steps ahead of slow pointer so that we always have n elements difference between the fast and the slow pointer. Now move both the pointers one step forward until the fast pointer reaches null. Then it all comes down to setting slow.next = slow.next.next. That's it, we're done!
